# Matt's OOC - Out of Combat Spell Reminder

![Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seathasky/MattOOC/refs/heads/main/preview.png)

MattOOC displays on-screen reminders when you're missing important buffs or don't have your pet summoned. 

> [!CAUTION]
Reminders only appear **out of combat** due to Blzzard addon API restrictions in Midnight. They also will only work before a M+ key has started and not during.

Track any buff or pet by name or spell ID, customize colors and effects, position each reminder independently, 
and save different setups per character. 

Type `/mattooc` to configure or click the minimap icon.
